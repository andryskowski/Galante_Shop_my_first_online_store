# Let’s Build: With Ruby on Rails – eCommerce Music Shop

Welcome to the next installment of my Let’s Build series featuring Ruby on Rails. In this span of six videos, I’ll walk you through the concept of building an eCommerce music shop in a Rails environment.

If you have followed my previous builds, I stem some ideas from those as well as establish some new ideas and techniques. Much of what is discussed I’ve covered before but there are some new concepts such as database seeding and session parameters I dive into in this series.

### What’s the app?

This series will involve creating a small start to an e-commerce application with user authentication. The application of which I call “Flanger” will revolve around selling and purchasing musical instruments.

The app will use a series of models to formulate both the cart and items of which are for sale. Along the way, we will craft some handy helpers that perform calculations to total the items within our cart as well as remember who a user is if that user adds an item to a cart without being logged in.

A user who has an account can post instruments for sale.

### What won’t we be covering?

Building a complete e-commerce application is quite a challenge. Often times you need user authentication, tons of options for listing items for sale, a solution for shopping carts, and of course payment options. Accepting payments is a topic I plan to cover in the future but for now, I am omitting this from the app for the sake of time and headache! If you would like to extend this app further you are more than welcome to. I personally use Stripe on other apps and have found great success with integrating it.
